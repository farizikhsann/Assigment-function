## Question-1

The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. It encrypts letters by shifting them over by a certain number of places in the alphabet. We call the length of shift the *key*. For example, if the key is 4, then *A* becomes E, *B* becomes F, *C* becomes G, and so on. To decrypt the message, you must shift the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages according to this algorithm.

Your solution is correct if the following output are all similar:

```python
input: '**Meet me by the rose bushes tonight.**'
output: 'QIIX QI FC XLI VSWI FYWLIW XSRMKLX.'
```
